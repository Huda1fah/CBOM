# CBOM Detector

A Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) Scanner and Quantum Risk Assessment Tool

## Overview

CBOM Detector is a tool designed to scan your system for cryptographic components and assess their vulnerability to quantum computing attacks. It helps you identify cryptographic algorithms being used in your browsers, system libraries, and hardware tokens, and provides recommendations for mitigating risks.

## Key Features

- Detects cryptographic components across browsers, system libraries, and hardware
- Identifies quantum-vulnerable algorithms in your system
- Provides a Quantum Readiness Score for your system
- Generates detailed HTML and JSON reports
- Offers recommendations for mitigating identified risks

## Installation

### Option 1: Install via pip

```bash
pip install CBOM
```

### Option 2: Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huda1fah/CBOM.git
cd CBOM
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the tool using:

```bash
CBOM
```

The tool will automatically:
1. Scan your system for cryptographic components
2. Analyze your browsers for crypto capabilities
3. Check for hardware security tokens
4. Generate a comprehensive report of findings
5. Calculate your system's Quantum Readiness Score
6. Provide recommendations for improving security

## Report Interpretation

The reports generated by CBOM Detector include:

- **System Information**: Details about your operating system and environment
- **Risk Summary**: Counts of critical, high, moderate, and low-risk components
- **Browser Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms used by your web browsers
- **System Cryptography**: Cryptographic libraries and modules on your system
- **Cryptographic Hardware**: Any detected security tokens or hardware modules
- **Recommended Mitigations**: Actions you can take to improve security
- **Quantum Readiness Score**: A measure of your system's ability to resist quantum attacks

## Risk Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Components that are already broken in classical computing
- **HIGH**: Components highly vulnerable to quantum attacks
- **MODERATE**: Components with some vulnerability to quantum attacks
- **LOW**: Components considered resistant to quantum attacks

## Quantum Readiness Score

The Quantum Readiness Score is calculated based on the proportion of your cryptographic components that are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks:

- **90-100**: Excellent - Your system is well-prepared for the quantum era
- **70-89**: Good - Most components are resistant, but some improvements needed
- **50-69**: Moderate - Significant vulnerabilities exist
- **0-49**: Poor - Your system is highly vulnerable to quantum attacks

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
